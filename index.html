<H2> Create your own SQL Learning Space </H2>

<p>Summer Classes are good for three things. Catching up on things that didn't take the first time around. Getting ahead of things so you can advance quicker. Taking advantage of smaller class sizes and instructor attention to improve the learning experience.</p>

<p>I just want to say, I've taken some SQL uni courses. I did things. Submitted papers and reports. Did reading. When I got into the workplace as a Data Analyst, I had to get a lot better and fast. There was a lot I could do, but a lot I could do better. I asked myself, "How could my classes have prepared me better? How could I have prepared myself better?"</p>

<p>The goal of this page/project is to walk thorugh how to set up a FREE test SQL experience in Azure and walk through some "hands-on" data work. I am trying to create the thing that would have helped me. I remember sitting down at the computer, and seeing hundreds of tables, dozens of columns, and millions of rows. I was a little overwhelmed. SELECT * on a large dataset is a bad idea.</p>

<p>However, for the aspiring data nerds, Microsoft has provided the foundation, and I would like to help you find and learn from it. Knowing that Microsoft has a couple complete SQL Database/Datasets that can be used in Azure will be enough for many people. I am the sort of person who enjoys writing and documentation. Feel free to stop reading when you have had enough. I tend to waffle on sometimes. When you have an environment set up and you can run queries, that is the big hurdle. Lots of other learning resources will be more accessible to you at that point. You could also continue following my exercise and typing along until it makes sense.<p>

<p>At the end, I'll include references of my favorite SQL references.</p>
