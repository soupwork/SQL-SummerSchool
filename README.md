# SQL-SummerSchool
SQL Learning Space

Summer Classes are good for three things. 
Catching up on things that didn't take the first time around.
Getting ahead of things so you can advance quicker.
Taking advantage of smaller class sizes and instructor attention to improve the learning experience.

I just want to say, I've taken some SQL uni courses. I did things. Submitted papers and reports. Did reading. When I got into the workplace as a Data Analyst, I had to get a lot better and fast. There was a lot I could do, but a lot I could do better. I asked myself, "How could my classes have prepared me better? How could I have prepared myself better?"

The goal of this page/project is to walk thorugh how to set up a test SQL experience in Azure and walk through some "hands-on" data work. I am trying to create the thing that would have helped me.
